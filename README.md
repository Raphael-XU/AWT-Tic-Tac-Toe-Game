This is my Tic-Tac-Toe game created using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). 

In order to play the game, you'll have to run the program first.

After running the program, shortly there will be a simple tic-tac-toe application that will show up.

This game can be played with 2 players, player 1/X and player 2/O.

If a player wins a game, it will automatically reset and start a new game.

Tic-Tac-Toe will also restart itself if the game results in a draw.

This Tic Tac Toe application features a "Start New Game" button at the bottom that will reset the game if the players want to reset.
